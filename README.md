# Colour Sorting Game 

A console-based color sorting game developed in C++ using core data structures like stacks and linked lists. This fun logic-based puzzle challenges players to sort colors by applying minimal moves, focusing on algorithmic thinking and data structure manipulation.

##  Game Highlights

- Stack-based logic implementation
- Linked list used for dynamic memory handling
- Clean text-based interface in the terminal
- Includes win/lose logic and replay functionality

## Concepts Used

- Stack (LIFO)
- Linked List (Node management)
- Procedural programming in C++
- Console Input/Output

## How to Play

1. Compile the game:
   ```bash
   g++ color_sorting_game.cpp -o game
Run it:

bash
Copy
Edit
./game
Follow on-screen instructions to move colored units between tubes.

Complete all tubes with sorted colors to win.
